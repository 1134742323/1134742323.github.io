        A new thermomechanical (TM) coupled finite-discrete element method (FDEM) model, incorporating heat conduction, thermal cracking, and contact heat transfer, has been proposed for both continuous and discontinuous geomaterials. This model incorporates a heat conduction model that can accurately calculate the thermal field in continuous–discontinuous transition processes within a finite element framework. A modified contact heat transfer model is also included, which accounts for the entire contact area of discrete bodies. To align with the finite strain theory utilized in the FDEM mechanics module, the TM coupling module in the model is based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient. The proposed model has been applied to various scenarios, including heat conduction in both continuous and discontinuous media during transient states, thermal-induced strain and stress, and thermal cracking conditions. The thermal field calculation model and the TM coupling model have been validated by comparing the numerical results with experiment findings and analytical solutions. These numerical cases demonstrate the reliability of the proposed model convincingly, making it suitable for use across a wide range of continuous and discontinuous media.

As part of the competition, YPLC (Hong Kong heat) was held by IOM3 (the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining) on 17th August 2023. PhD student Zihan Liu (under the supervision of Dr Louis Wong) from the Department of Earth Sciences of HKU participated in the heat and won the championship (1st out of 9) in this competition, for a presentation on “How does thermal shock affect rocks?”. He will then represent Hong Kong to join the forthcoming YPWLC world final in November 2023.

Zihan presented his latest research on the thermal shock effects in rocks. When rocks experience rapid heating or cooling, temperature change-induced thermal deformation differs among adjacent mineral grains and thus creates intragranular and intergranular microcracks. Thermal shock sometimes changes the microstructure of rocks and thus permanently alters the physico-mechanical properties of rocks. Through theoretical and experimental investigation, the mechanical response of rocks under thermal shock loading and influencing factors of thermal shock can be comprehended. This research can further expand the knowledge of geotechnical engineering disciplines and promote the development of deep underground space and energy.
