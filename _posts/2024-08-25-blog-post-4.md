Zihan Liu’s report entitled “A new thermomechanical coupled FDEM model for geomaterials considering continuum-discontinuum transitions (TM-FDEM)”. He and his supervisor Prof. Louis Ngai Yuen Wong proposed a novel thermomechanical (TM) coupled algorithm based on the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM), incorporating heat conduction, thermal cracking, and contact heat transfer. This model incorporates a heat conduction model that can accurately calculate the thermal field in continuous–discontinuous transition processes within a finite element framework. A modified contact heat transfer model is also included, which accounts for the entire contact area of discrete bodies. TM-FDEM is expected to provide a valuable theoretical reference for deep-earth rock mechanics and engineering. This work has been published in the Journal of Rock Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (IF = 9.4), which ranked 1/63 in the JCR category: Engineering, Geological.
